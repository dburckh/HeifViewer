# HeifViewer
This is an Android app that I was using to test the Heif parsing of IsoParserLite.  I was nerding out using MediaCodec to decode HEIC/AVIF manual.  For educational purposes only.  Use ImageDecoder for production code.

## Usage
Click the button, select a .heic or .avif file and be amazed (or not).
